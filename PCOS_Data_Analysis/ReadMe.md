Title: PCOS Data Analysis

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
To analyze clinical and lifestyle data of women to identify key factors associated with PCOS, uncover patterns, and build predictive insights that can assist in early diagnosis and awareness.

ðŸ“‹ Project Summary:
Worked with a real-world dataset (from Kaggle or clinical source) containing medical and demographic information of women, including features like age, BMI, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), AMH, weight, irregular cycles, and others.

ðŸŒŸ Key Insights:
BMI, LH/FSH ratio, irregular cycles, and hormonal imbalances showed strong correlation with PCOS.

Women with higher BMI and LH/FSH ratio >2 had significantly higher risk.

Certain lifestyle factors like physical activity level and weight management were also influential.
